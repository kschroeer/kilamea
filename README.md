# Kilamea
@author Kay Schr√∂er (acsf.dev@gmail.com)

Kilamea is a messaging software developed specifically for the needs of blind and visually impaired users, i.e. the focus is on a slim user interface (e.g. with a sidebar, classic menus, separate dialog windows) and keyboard operation (e.g. using shortcuts).

Of course, anyone not affected can also use the software with pleasure. Everything can be easily controlled with a mouse as well. I have simply refrained from elaborate layouts in the design.

## Main features

- Reading, writing, replying, and forwarding messages
- Plain text editor
- Easy handling of file attachments
- Managing email accounts and folders
- Address book

## Future goals

- Access to Gmail
- Integration of rich text editor
- Spellcheck capability
- Implementation of spam filter
